“This Lambda cleans up unused snapshots by checking their connection to EBS volumes. It deletes snapshots only if they are not attached to any volume or if their volume is not attached to any EC2 instance. Note that it does not touch volumes or EC2 instances themselves. For volumes attached to stopped EC2 instances, snapshots are preserved — because technically, the volume is still in use.”
